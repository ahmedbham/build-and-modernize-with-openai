In this lab, we've initially set <code>max_articles_num</code> to 500 for speedier results, allowing you to observe the outcomes faster. Once you've done an initial run, consider increasing this value to 750 or 1,000. You'll likely notice that the context provided to the LLM becomes richer and better. You can experiment by gradually raising this variable for different queries to observe the improvements in the LLM's contextual understanding.</p>"

      "The Berlin Wall was a physical barrier that divided the city of Berlin, Germany from 1961 to 1989. It was built by the German Democratic Republic (GDR), also known as East Germany, in an effort to prevent its citizens from fleeing to the democratic West Germany.\n",
      "\n",
      "The construction of the Berlin Wall began on August 13, 1961, and it consisted of a concrete wall, barbed wire, and guard towers. The wall stretched for 96 miles, dividing the city into two separate parts. The East German government claimed that the wall was built to protect its citizens from Western imperialism and to prevent spies and agents from entering the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the real purpose of the Berlin Wall was to prevent East Germans from escaping to the West. Before the wall was built, thousands of East Germans had been fleeing to West Germany every day, seeking better economic opportunities and political freedom. The wall effectively cut off all access to the West, trapping East Germans in their own country.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Berlin Wall became a symbol of the Cold War and the division between the communist East and the democratic West. Families and friends were separated, and many lives were lost in attempts to cross the wall. The most famous incident was the death of Peter Fechter on August 17, 1962, when he was shot by East German guards while trying to escape to the West.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Berlin Wall stood for 28 years, until November 9, 1989, when the East German government announced that its citizens were free to cross the border. This announcement led to a joyous celebration as people from both sides of the wall came together and began tearing it down. The fall of the Berlin Wall marked the end of the Cold War and the beginning of German reunification.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, the Berlin Wall is a symbol of the struggle for freedom and the human desire for unity. Parts of the wall still stand as a reminder of the division that once existed, and a memorial has been built to honor those who lost their lives trying to cross it. The Berlin Wall serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of freedom and the consequences of division.\n"
